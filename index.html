          <h3>Darkest Dungeon</h3>

          <img src="https://github.com/TheHarlander/pages/blob/master/images/DarkestDungeonUI.png?raw=true" alt="Darkest Dungeon UI" style="width:500px;height:328px;">
          <p> Darkest dungeons user interface is somewhat remarklable, to have so much information in a easy to see and use layout is interesting. Dedicating 1/3 of the screen to it's UI may seem like
          a bad idea but having so many items such as names, abilities, health, stats, gear, items and a map all on this UI it does so beautifully.</p>


          <<h3>Visibility of system status:</h3>
<p>
Darkest dungeon’s visibility of system status is done rather well, in terms the player knows what is going on they have an array of indications, text and visual indicators to let them know. Firstly they have health bars under every character on screen allowing quick indication on how much health that character has, for more specific values of that character's health one can click that character to see in numeric values the character's health. The way this is done allows the user the choice not to be overwhelmed with information if they do not need to know it. Following on with a similar status indicator is buffs and boons, above a character's health if they were either to get a buff or a boon a small image would appear. It allows the player to know what has happened but also allows them to highlight over it to see the more specific stats on it, for example “blight does 4 damage for 2 more rounds”.
</p>
<h3>Consistency and standards:</h3>
<p>Like many other 2d rpg games, darkest dungeon follows the trend that make the player recognize similar items that makes what looks like a complex user interface a lot easier. Abilities have a small image to represent the attack and a number key assigned to it, players who have past played any similar game would understand that this is an ability. It goes the same with the stats, they use abbreviations for the stats so someone who has not played these types before would not understand what they mean. The flee and map also have world known images for these, a white flag used as a symbol of surrender and a map for a map.
</p>
<h3>Error prevention:</h3>
<p>Error prevention is an important aspect to prevent the player from doing a mistake on their part. Darkest dungeon has a system where every action in the game is saved automatically, you would think that with this as a main feature there would be a lot of error prevention but there is only one. The flee button is the only action the player can make where it issues a warning on what they are about to do, this flee button is a small white flag at the top left of the screen. This is also the only button up in that space so there wouldn't be any chance of miss clicking on that button.
All though it would be key to have a lot more error prevention in a game like this it would also get very tedious having to confirm a lot of the things you can do.
</p>
<h3>?Recognition:</h3> <p>
Almost all of the user interface are images, images instead of text allows the player to recognize instead of recall what the user interface item does. Items, abilities and health all are represented by an image that could easily be linked to what it stands for. Health has a heart next to it, abilities have a small representation of what the ability will do and items are all matched to what they actually are.
