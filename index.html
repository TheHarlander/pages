          <h3>Darkest Dungeon</h3>

          <img src="https://github.com/TheHarlander/pages/blob/master/images/DarkestDungeonUI.png?raw=true" alt="Darkest Dungeon UI" style="width:500px;height:328px;">
          <p> Darkest dungeons user interface is somewhat remarklable, to have so much information in a easy to see and use layout is interesting. Dedicating 1/3 of the screen to it's UI may seem like
          a bad idea but having so many items such as names, abilities, health, stats, gear, items and a map all on this UI it does so beautifully.</p>


          <h3>Visibility of system status:</h3>
<p>
Darkest dungeon’s visibility of system status is done rather well, in terms the player knows what is going on they have an array of indications, text and visual indicators to let them know. Firstly they have health bars under every character on screen allowing quick indication on how much health that character has, for more specific values of that character's health one can click that character to see in numeric values the character's health. The way this is done allows the user the choice not to be overwhelmed with information if they do not need to know it. Following on with a similar status indicator is buffs and boons, above a character's health if they were either to get a buff or a boon a small image would appear. It allows the player to know what has happened but also allows them to highlight over it to see the more specific stats on it, for example “blight does 4 damage for 2 more rounds”.
</p>
<h3>Consistency and standards:</h3>
<p>Like many other 2d rpg games, darkest dungeon follows the trend that make the player recognize similar items that makes what looks like a complex user interface a lot easier. Abilities have a small image to represent the attack and a number key assigned to it, players who have past played any similar game would understand that this is an ability. It goes the same with the stats, they use abbreviations for the stats so someone who has not played these types before would not understand what they mean. The flee and map also have world known images for these, a white flag used as a symbol of surrender and a map for a map.
</p>
<h3>Error prevention:</h3>
<p>Error prevention is an important aspect to prevent the player from doing a mistake on their part. Darkest dungeon has a system where every action in the game is saved automatically, you would think that with this as a main feature there would be a lot of error prevention but there is only one. The flee button is the only action the player can make where it issues a warning on what they are about to do, this flee button is a small white flag at the top left of the screen. This is also the only button up in that space so there wouldn't be any chance of miss clicking on that button.
All though it would be key to have a lot more error prevention in a game like this it would also get very tedious having to confirm a lot of the things you can do.
</p>
<h3>Recognition:</h3> <p>
Almost all of the user interface are images, images instead of text allows the player to recognize instead of recall what the user interface item does. Items, abilities and health all are represented by an image that could easily be linked to what it stands for. Health has a heart next to it, abilities have a small representation of what the ability will do and items are all matched to what they actually are.

<h1>Survey monkey, got 23 responses in total</h1>

<h3>Question 1. On a scale from 1-10, how would you rate your knowledge of games?</h3>
<p>The majority of people who took this survey were either 8 or 7 showing a high knowledge of games, this may be down to the fact that people were only interested in taking the survey because it was games related. Although this could be a bad result, when looking at reviewing a User interface for a game you want people who are passionate about games rather than people who are not.</p>

<h3>Question 2. At first look can you tell me what is happening in the picture above.</h3>
<p>90% of participants could correctly guess that there is a battle happening in the background. This question was used to make sure that they understood what kind of user interface they should expect while a battle happens in this game.</p>

<h3>Question 3.Can you tell me a few different User Interface features you can see.</h3>
<p>The 2 main components that participants recognised was health and items, as this is used in a high amount of games. The next most stated components was stats and abilities again these are a very recognizable</p>

<h3>Question 4. If I said can you use an attack, could you locate it?</h3>
<p>These results were surprising about half of the people knew where it was and the other half did not. The image numbers components are used in a lot of RPG games, this could be down to them not having a diverse knowledge or without explanation it was hard to distinguish between the number abilities and the weapon and armour which a few people thought this was attack and defend.</p>
<h3>Question 5.If I said can you use an item, could you locate it?</h3>
<p>About 75% of the participants knew that the inventory system is at the bottom right but the others thought that the 4 slots(weapon,armor and trinkets) at the bottom left.</p>

<h3>Question 6: If I said can you use the map, could you locate it?</h3>
<p>9 participants knew that the small map image in the bottom right was in fact the map system, this is quite astounding as a representation of a map should make people recognise it as the map. I think because the image is so small it is hard to find if you do not know where it is, even in game it is hard to click as it is so small.</p>

<h3>Question 7. On a scale from 1-10, how would you rate the readability of this user interface?</h3>
<p>There was a diverse response to this from as low as 2 to as high as 8.7. I found from people who understood where and what things were that they gave a higher rating, whereas people who did not gave a very low rating.</p>

<h3>Question 8. Is there anything that you could suggest to improve this user interface?</h3>
<p>The major improvement I saw people suggest was to make it simpler and not have as many things on screen. They found because there was so many components on the screen they got confused.</p>

<h3>Question 9.Can you name 1 thing you like about this UI and 1 thing you dislike.</h3>
<p>The majority of participants liked the aesthetic design of the ui but then just stated they did not like the design. This question did not assist me much so i should of rephrased it better.
